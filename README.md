# ShellStartUpScript

ShellStartUpScript is a collection of shell startup and configuration scripts used to customize and standardize development environments.

> ⚠️ Just for fun! Use at your own risk – these scripts are meant for experimentation and learning, not production-critical setups.


This repository primarily contains shell initialization files such as `.zshrc`, `.bashrc` along with related scripts and snippets that help automate environment setup, improve productivity, 
and maintain consistent shell behavior across machines.
